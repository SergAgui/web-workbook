          <p>Sergio is a developer, husband, friend, and according to rumors, adept around the kitchen. Whether it's night or day,
            family will keep him grounded and his dogs keep him active. He's always held customer service and customer experience as the
            top priority when working with past, present, and future clients through the quality of his work.
